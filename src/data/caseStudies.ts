 * Case studies are rendered by one template (src/pages/CaseStudy.tsx) from the
 * records below, so every project page has the same structure.
 *
 * To publish a new project, add its concept/project to the relevant service
 * data file (e.g. src/data/branding.ts) so it appears on /work, then add an
 * entry to `details` below keyed by its name. Anything left out is simply
 * hidden on the page, so a record can start small and grow:
 *
 *   challenge   the problem the client faced
 *   results     real, measurable outcomes: [{ value: '+42%', label: 'Organic traffic' }]
 *   testimonial a real quote with name and role
 *   gallery     extra images: [{ src, alt }]
 *   tools       stack or software used
 *   year        '2026'
 *   isConcept   false for real work (changes the labels); past projects live in
 *               src/data/projects.ts
